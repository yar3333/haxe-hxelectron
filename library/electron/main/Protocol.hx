		A standard scheme adheres to what RFC 3986 calls generic URI syntax. For example http and https are standard schemes, while file is not. Registering a scheme as standard, will allow relative and absolute resources to be resolved correctly when served. Otherwise the scheme will behave like the file protocol, but without the ability to resolve relative URLs. For example when you load following page with custom protocol without registering it as standard scheme, the image will not be loaded because non-standard schemes can not recognize relative URLs: Registering a scheme as standard will allow access to files through the FileSystem API. Otherwise the renderer will throw a security error for the scheme. By default web storage apis (localStorage, sessionStorage, webSQL, indexedDB, cookies) are disabled for non standard schemes. So in general if you want to register a custom protocol to replace the http protocol, you have to register it as a standard scheme: Note: This method can only be used before the ready event of the app module gets emitted.

		Registers a protocol of scheme that will send the file as a response. The handler will be called with handler(request, callback) when a request is going to be created with scheme. completion will be called with completion(null) when scheme is successfully registered or completion(error) when failed. To handle the request, the callback should be called with either the file's path or an object that has a path property, e.g. callback(filePath) or callback({path: filePath}). When callback is called with nothing, a number, or an object that has an error property, the request will fail with the error number you specified. For the available error numbers you can use, please see the net error list. By default the scheme is treated like http:, which is parsed differently than protocols that follow the "generic URI syntax" like file:, so you probably want to call protocol.registerStandardSchemes to have your scheme treated as a standard scheme.
